### Starting ###

The hadoop cluster must be started in the following order

On the Namenode and Jobtracker designated machine start the following. If Namenode and Jobtracker 
processes are to be run on seperate machines, then run these commands seperately.

```sh
service hadoop-0.20-namenode start && service hadoop-0.20-jobtracker start
```

On all the machines run the Datanode and Tasktracker processes. If the Datanode and Tasktracker 
processes are to be run on seperate machines, then start the processes seperately.

```sh
service hadoop-0.20-datanode start && service hadoop-0.20-tasktracker start
```
