# Tessera Stack Cluster Installation #

## Overview ##

### Content ###

The Tessera stack comprises the components RHIPE, Datadr, and Trelliscope. This is a guide to 
installing all of these components on a multi-node cluster. In particular, installing and running
RHIPE requires Hadoop, an embarrassingly parallel computational platform. We have tested the 
Tessera stack on Debian Linux Derivative - Ubuntu (Version 10.04 or 12.04).

Installion of the Tessera stack should proceed in the following steps:

1. Installation Step
The following packages (listed in order of installation) are required to run the Tessera stack successfully.
  * System Update and Packages
  * Sun/Oracle Java - 6 or 7 (For 7 use any release before subversion 51)
  * Protocal Buffer - 2.4.1
  * Cloudera Hadoop - cdh3u5
  * R - 3.0.1
  * Binutils (specific to Ubuntu) and rJava - 0.96
  * RHIPE - 0.74
  * R Packages: codetools, MASS, lattice, boot, shiny, and devtools
  * Datadr
  * Trelliscope
  * Rstudio
  * Shiny Server
  
  Note: Some of these packages are updated quite frequently. Please verify that they are compatible 
  with the Tessera stack and Hadoop before installing.

2. Configuration Step
  * Host File
  * Hadoop Core
  * Hadoop MapReduce
  * Hadoop HDFS

3. Hadoop Cluster Starting
The details of installing each component are described in the subsequent sections.
