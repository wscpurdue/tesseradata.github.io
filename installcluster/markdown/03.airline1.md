## Airline Data  ##

The Airline data set consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights from
1987 to 2008. The approximately 120MM records (CSV format), occupy 120GB space. The data set was used 
for the Visualization Poster Competition, JSM 2009. The winning entries can be found 
[here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/). To quote the objectives

  “The aim of the data expo is to provide a graphical summary of important features of the data set. 
This is intentionally vague in order to allow different entries to focus on different aspects of the
data, but here are a few ideas to get you started:

- When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
- Do older planes suffer more delays?
- How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
- How well does weather predict plane delays?
- Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there 
critical links in the system?”

In this chapter, we will demonstrate RHIPE code samples to create similar graphics found in the 
winning entries [SAS] and [FLUSA].

### Copying the Data to the HDFS ###

The Airline data can be found [at this site](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html).
In this example, we download the data sets for the individual years and save them on the HDFS with
the following code (with limited error checks)


```r
library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
map <- expression({
  msys <- function(on){
    system(sprintf("wget  %s --directory-prefix ./tmp 2> ./errors", on))
    if(length(grep("(failed)|(unable)", readLines("./errors"))) > 0){
      stop(paste(readLines("./errors"), collapse="\n"))
    }
  }
  lapply(map.values, function(r){
    x = 1986 + r
    on <- sprintf("http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/%s.csv.bz2", x)
    fn <- sprintf("./tmp/%s.csv.bz2", x)
    rhstatus(sprintf("Downloading %s", on))
    msys(on)
    rhstatus(sprintf("Downloading %s", on))
    system(sprintf('bunzip2 %s', fn))
    rhstatus(sprintf("Unzipped %s", on))
    rhcounter("FILES", x, 1)
    rhcounter("FILES", "_ALL_", 1)
  })
})
z <- rhwatch(
  map       = map,
  input     = rep(length(1987:2008), 2),
  output    = "/tmp/airline/data",
  mapred    = list( mapred.reduce.tasks = 0, mapred.task.timeout = 0 ),
  copyFiles = TRUE,
  readback  = FALSE,
  noeval    = TRUE
)
j <- rhex(z, async = TRUE)
```


A lot is demonstrated in this code. `RHIPE` is loaded via the call in first line. A MapReduce job 
takes a set of input keys, in this case the numbers 1987 to 2008. It also takes a corresponding set
of values. The parameter `input` in `rhwatch` tells `RHIPE` how to convert the input the data to key, 
value pairs. If the input file is a binary file but `input` specifies `text` as the `type`, `RHIPE`
will not throw an error but provide very unexpected key/value pairs. `input` in this case is lapply,
which treats the numbers 1 to `input[1]` as both keys and values.

These key/value pairs are partitioned into splits. How they are partitioned depends on the `type` in
`input` argument. For text files which specifies `type="text"` in `input`, the data
is split into roughly equi-length blocks of e.g. 128MB each. A CSV text file will have approximately
equal number of lines per block (not necessarily). `RHIPE` will launch R across all the compute
nodes. Each node is responsible for processing a the key/value pairs in its assigned splits.

This processing is performed in the map argument to `rhwatch`. The map argument is an R expression.
Hadoop will read key,value pairs, send them to RHIPE which in turn buffers them by storing them in 
a R list: `map.values` and `map.keys` respectively. Once the buffer is full, RHIPE calls the map 
expression. The default length of `map.values` (and `map.keys`) is 10,000 [1].

In our example, `input[1]` is 22. The variables `map.values` and `map.keys` will be lists of numbers
1 to 22 and number 1 to 22 respectively. The entries need not be in the order 1 to 22.

`rhwatch` is a call that packages the MapReduce job which is sent to Hadoop. It takes an input folder
which can contain multiple files and subfolders. All the files will be given as input. If a 
particular file cannot be understood by the input format (e.g. a text file given to `type="sequence"`),
`RHIPE` will throw an error.

The expression downloads the CSV file, unzips its, and stores in the folder tmp located in the 
current directory. No copying is performed. The current directory is a temporary directory on the
local filesystem of the compute node, not on the HDFS. Upon successful completion of the split, 
the files stored in tmp (of the current directory) will be copied to the output folder specified
by ofolder in the call to rhmr. Files are copied only if copyFiles is set to `TRUE`.

Once a file has been downloaded, we inform Hadoop of our change in status, via `rhstatus`. The 
example of rhstatus displays the various status of each of the 22 splits (also called Tasks)

Once a file has been downloaded, we increment a distributed count. Counts belong to families, a 
single family contains many counters. The counter for group G and name N is incremented via a call
to `rhcounter`. We increment a counter for each of the 22 files. Since each file is downloaded once, 
this is essentially a flag to indicate successful download. A count of files downloaded is tracked 
in Files/\_ALL\_ .

The operation of Hadoop is affected by many options, some of which can be found in Options for 
`RHIPE`. Hadoop will terminate splits (tasks) after 10 minutes if they do not invoke `rhstatus`
or return. Since each download takes approximately 30 minutes (the minimum is 4 minutes, the 
maximum is 42 minutes, the mean is 30 minutes), Hadoop will kill the tasks. We tell Hadoop to not
kill long running tasks by setting `mapred.task.timeout` to 0. We do not to need to reduce our 
results so we set `mapred.reduce.tasks` to 0. Output from the map is written directly to the output
folder on the HDFS. We do not have any output. These options are passed in the mapred argument.

The call to `rhex` launches the job across Hadoop. We use the async argument to return control of 
the R console to the user. We can monitor the status by calling `rhstatus`, giving it the value 
returned from `rhex` or the job ID (e.g. job_201007281701_0053)


```r
rhstatus(j)
```

This distributed download took 2 minutes to complete, 15 seconds more than the longest running 
download (2007.csv.bz2). A sequential download would have taken several hours.

**Note**  
It is important to note that the above code is mostly boiler plate. There is almost no lines to 
handle distribution across a cluster or task restart in case of transient node failure. The user
of RHIPE need only consider how to frame her argument in the concepts of MapReduce.

`rhls` function can help us to list all files under a directory on HDFS.


```r
rhls("/tmp/airline/data")
```

```

### Converting to R Objects ###

The data needs to be converted to R objects. Since we will be doing repeated analyses on the data,
it is better to spend time converting them to R objects making subsequent computations faster, 
rather than tokenizing strings and converting to R objects for every analysis.

A sample of the text file

```
1987,10,14,3,741,730,912,849,PS,1451,NA,91,79,NA,23,11,SAN,SFO,447,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
1987,10,15,4,729,730,903,849,PS,1451,NA,94,79,NA,14,-1,SAN,SFO,447,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
1987,10,17,6,741,730,918,849,PS,1451,NA,97,79,NA,29,11,SAN,SFO,447,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
...
```

The meaning of the columns can be found [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html)
. Rather than store the entire 120MM rows as one big data frame, it is efficient to store it as
rectangular blocks of R rows and M columns. We will not store all the above columns only the 
following:
- Dates: day of week, date, month and year (1,2,3, and 4)
- Arrival and departure times: actual and scheduled (5,6,7 and 8)
- Flight time: actual and scheduled (12 and 13)
- Origin and Destination: airport code, latitude and longitude (17 and 18)
- Distance (19)
- Carrier Name (9)
Since latitude and longitude are not present in the data sets, we will compute them later as 
required. Carrier names are located in a different R data set which will be used to do perform 
carrier code to carrier name translation.

Before we start any mapreduce job for converting, there is one thing we have to do. As we already
seen previously, the real text files are located in `/tmp/airline/data/_outputs/` directory. The 
underscore at the beginning of a directory/file on HDFS makes the system to treat the directory/file 
as invisible. That's why when we read from a directory that is an output from a mapreduce job, those
file '_SUCCESS' and '_logs'are skipped and only files 'part-m-...' are read in. So in order to read 
in those csv files, we have to change the name of directory to be without underscore.


```r
rhmv("/tmp/airline/data/_outputs", "/tmp/airline/data/outputs")
rhls("/tmp/airline/data")
```

```
   permission owner      group        size          modtime                           file
1  -rw-r--r-- tongx supergroup           0 2014-06-11 10:44     /tmp/airline/data/_SUCCESS
2  drwxrwxrwt tongx supergroup           0 2014-06-11 10:43        /tmp/airline/data/_logs
3  drwxr-xr-x tongx supergroup           0 2014-06-11 22:05      /tmp/airline/data/outputs
4  -rw-r--r-- tongx supergroup    94 bytes 2014-06-11 10:44 /tmp/airline/data/part-m-00000
5  -rw-r--r-- tongx supergroup    94 bytes 2014-06-11 10:44 /tmp/airline/data/part-m-00001
...
```
Now we are ready to go. First, we would like to store the data set as blocks of 5000 \(\times\) 12 
rows and columns. These will be the values. The class of the values will be data.frame in R, and 
every value must be mapped to a key. In this example, the keys (indices) to these blocks will not 
have any meaning but will be unique. The key is the first scheduled departure time.

The format of the data is a Sequence File, which can store binary representations of R objects.

There are 37 splits for the mapreduce job. A split can consist of many `map.values` that need to be 
processed. For text files as input, a split is 128MB or whatever your Hadoop block size is. In map
expression, we first define a R function `convertHHMM()`, which will be used to separate an input 
of four digit time record (hhmm) to a vector with hour and minute separately. Then we iterate over
the `map.values`, which are the lines in text files, and tokenizing them. The first line in each 
downloaded file is about thevariable names. The first line starts with column year which must be 
ignored. The lines of text are aggregated using `rbind` and time related columns converted to datetime
objects. The data frame is sorted by scheduled departure and saved to disk indexed by the range of 
scheduled departures in the data frame. The size of the value (data frame) is important. RHIPE will 
can write any sized object but cannot read key/value pairs that are more than 256MB. A data frame 
of 5000 rows and 12 columns fits very well into 256MB.

Running R across massive data can be illuminating. Without the calls to `ISOdatetime`, it is much 
faster to complete.

### Sorted Keys ###

A reduce is not needed in this example. The text data is blocked into data frames and written to 
disk. With 128MB block sizes and each block a split, each split being mapped by one R session, 
there 96 files each containing several data frames. The reduce expression writes each incoming 
intermediate value (a data frame) to disk. This is called an identity reducer which can be used 
for

1. Map file indexing. The intermediate keys are sorted. In the identity reduce, these keys are
written to disk in sorted order. If the `type` of output is `map`, the output can be used as
an external memory hash table. Given a key, `RHIPE` can use Hadoop to very quickly discover the 
location of the key in the sorted (by key) output data and return the associated value. Thus even
when no reduce logic is required the user can provide the identity reduce to create a queryable 
Map File from the map output.

2. Intermediate keys are sorted. But they can be sorted in different ways. `RHIPE`’s default is byte
ordering i.e the keys are serialized to bytes and sorted byte wise. However, byte ordering is very
different from semantic ordering. Thus keys e.g. 10,-1,20 which might be byte ordered are certainly
not numerically ordered. `RHIPE` can numerically order keys so that in the reduce expression the 
user is guaranteed to receive the keys in sorted numeric order. In the above code, we request this 
feature by using `orderby` argument. Numeric sorting is as follows: keys A and B are ordered if A < B
and of unit length or A[i] < B[i], 1$\le$ i $\le$ min(length(A), length(B))[2]. For keys 1, (2,1), 
(1,1), 5, (1, 3, 4), (2, 1), 4, (4, 9) the ordering is 1, (1, 1),(1, 3, 4), (2, 1), (2, 1), 4, (4, 9),
5 Using this ordering, all the values in a given file will be ordered by the range of the scheduled 
departures. Using this custom sorter can be slower than the default byte ordering. Bear in mind, the
keys in a part file will be ordered but keys in one part file need not be less than those in another 
part file.

To achieve ordering of keys set `orderby` in the call to `rhwatch` to one of bytes (default), 
integer, numeric (for doubles) or character (alphabetical sorting) in the mapred argument to 
`rhwatch`. If the output format is sequence, you also need to provide a reducer which can be an 
identity reducer. Note, if your keys are discrete, it is best to use integer ordering. Values of
`NA` can throw of ordering and will send all key,values to one reducer causing a severe imbalance.


```r
reduce = expression({
  reduce={ lapply(reduce.values,function(r) rhcollect(reduce.key,r)) }
})
```


3. To decrease the number of files. In this case decreasing the number of files is hardly needed, 
but it can be useful if one has more thousands of splits.

In situations (1) and (3), the user does not have to provide the R reduce expression and can leave 
this parameter empty. In situation (2), you need to provide the above code. Also, (2) is incompatible
with Map File outputs (i.e `type` in `output` set to `map`). Case (2) is mostly useful for time 
series algorithms in the reduce section e.g. keys of the form (identifier, i) where identifier is an 
object and i ranges from 1 to n_{identifier}. For each key, the value is sorted time series data. 
The reducer will receive the values for the keys (identifier, i) in the order of i for a given 
identifier. This also assumes the user has partitioned the data on identifier (see the `partition` 
parameter of `rhwatch`: for this to work, all the keys (identifier, i) with the same identifier 
need to be sent to the same reducer).
